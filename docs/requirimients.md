# Challenge introduction

As we want to provide a better experience for our users, we aim to represent their itinerary in the most comprehensive way possible.

## Input

We receive the reservations of our user, who we know is based in SVQ, as:

```
# input.txt

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Flight SVQ 2023-03-02 06:40 -> BCN 09:10

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Hotel BCN 2023-01-05 -> 2023-01-10

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Flight SVQ 2023-01-05 20:40 -> BCN 22:10
SEGMENT: Flight BCN 2023-01-10 10:30 -> SVQ 11:50

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Train SVQ 2023-02-15 09:30 -> MAD 11:00
SEGMENT: Train MAD 2023-02-17 17:00 -> SVQ 19:30

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Hotel MAD 2023-02-15 -> 2023-02-17

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Flight BCN 2023-03-02 15:00 -> NYC 22:45
```

## Output

When running a command like `BASED=SVQ bundle exec ruby main.rb input.txt`, we want to display a UI like this:

```
TRIP to BCN
Flight from SVQ to BCN at 2023-01-05 20:40 to 22:10
Hotel at BCN on 2023-01-05 to 2023-01-10
Flight from BCN to SVQ at 2023-01-10 10:30 to 11:50

TRIP to MAD
Train from SVQ to MAD at 2023-02-15 09:30 to 11:00
Hotel at MAD on 2023-02-15 to 2023-02-17
Train from MAD to SVQ at 2023-02-17 17:00 to 19:30

TRIP to NYC
Flight from SVQ to BCN at 2023-03-02 06:40 to 09:10
Flight from BCN to NYC at 2023-03-02 15:00 to 22:45
```
## Goal

You have to write Ruby code that reads the input from the file `input.txt` and prints the expected output.

## Notes

- You should implement the sorting and grouping logic for the segments.
- You can assume that segments won’t overlap.
- IATA codes are always three-letter uppercase strings: SVQ, MAD, BCN, NYC
- You may consider two flights to be a connection if there is less than 24 hours difference.

- You can use external frameworks or libraries if you want.
- You can attach notes explaining the solution and why certain things are included and others are left out.
- The solution should be production-ready.
- You should provide a solution that is easy to extend.
